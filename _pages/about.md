I'm a current CS Master's student at KAUST, where I'm fortunate to be working under the guidance of Professor Robert Hoehndorf. While also engaging in data science projects at Mozn.

I try to navigate the fine line between productivity and joy, directness and sarcasm. I enjoy asking questions, learning new things, engaging in discussions with interesting people, and solving problems. My questions often revolve around artificial intelligence and human experience.

When I need to recharge, you'll likely find me taking a walk, watching a football match (the one mainly played with feet!), playing simple board games, or hitting the net while practicing tennis.
