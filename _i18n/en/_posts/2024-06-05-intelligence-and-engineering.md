I just finished up a course on NeuroSymbolic AI, and there was this one question that kept popping up: What is intelligence, anyway? It seemed that field experts traditionally believed intelligence to be the human ability to use complex symbols, such as language, for communication. 

But the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) debunked this hypothesis; LLMs demonstrate a remarkable ability to utilize symbols for communication, arguably even better than humans, through a purely statistical autoregressive process. This doesn't really fit our general perception of intelligence, contributing to a new ambiguity about intelligence definition. I believe it is a similar ambiguity to when we try to explain what love is! In this essay, I want to share my current thoughts on what intelligence is, not love.


Before I say exactly what I think intelligence is, I want to talk about the thing that always comes to mind when I think about it: complex systems. Whenever I travel and have nothing to do but overthink, I'm always amazed by the aviation ecosystem. It seems almost implausible that humans built these giant metal birds that fly through the air, following invisible paths at crazy speeds, and connect different continents with minimal risk. Then you land, and there is this whole other world of complex systems working together to make sure everyone gets their bags and the planes are ready to go again. Aviation, the global economy, even laptops â€“ these are all super complex systems that manifest human intelligence.


One way to figure out what intelligence is to think about what it is not. This concept appears to highly correlate with oversimplification. It is simpler to believe in a single family controlling the world than to try to understand the global economy and politics. It is simpler to attribute vice to the Illuminati than to read about the history of morality. And it is simpler to think one AI model will solve all our problems than to learn statistics. Oversimplification appears to be inherent in human nature, as it provides easily digestible answers and justifies a reluctance to learn. However, intelligence seems to be a necessary tool for overcoming this natural tendency.


So, after thinking about all this, I've come to believe that intelligence is the ability to plan, build, and run a system of various components, while constantly refining its processes. Basically, intelligence is the ability to engineer stuff. This probably explains why I keep saying "we should engineer it" whenever I'm talking about problems!
